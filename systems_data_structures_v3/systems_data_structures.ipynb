Given that we will spend the rest of the semester working with Numpy, a matrix multiplication library, we shall have you implement the features necessary to implement linear regression inference using **your own matrix library**. To do so in full generality, we shall first focus on developing your intuitions regarding how matrices work in Numpy.\n","\n","As you might recall, most data structures that require strong sequential access patterns are implemented as one-dimensional lists. Matrices are the same, where the underlying data structure is simply a one-dimensional list. In order to provide an interface for matrices that allows us to have multi-dimensional access in an efficient way, all matrix data structures contain both a vector defining the shape of the matrix ( the length of each dimension ) and the stride of the matrix.\n","\n","Here, a stride is simply a vector that tells us how many elements to move when traversing an array across any axis. If you had the following:\n","```\n","data = [2,1,0,5,4,3,8,7,6,11,10,9]\n","shape = [4,3]\n","stride = [3,1]\n","```\n","This would be equivalent to the following 4x3 matrix:\n","```\n","[[2,1,0],[5,4,3],[8,7,6],[11,10,9]]\n","```\n","\n","The stride is used for finding an element efficiently. For example, say we want to find the element at position (3, 2) for the above matrix, we would find it like so in Python:\n","```\n","matrix = [[2,1,0],[5,4,3],[8,7,6],[11,10,9]]\n","element = matrix[3][2] # This element would be 9\n","```\n","However, the matrix is stored as an 1D array in our underlying memory (which we could visualize as ```data_in_memory = [2,1,0,5,4,3,8,7,6,11,10,9]```)\n","To find the element we want (9) efficiently, we use stride to find the position of 9 in the 1D array:\n","\n","```\n","# (3, 2) is the position of the element of the 2D array we want to find\n","# The stride is [3, 1]\n","offset = 3*3 + 2*1 # Which would equal 11.

If you have the following Matrix data:\n","\n","```\n","data = [0,1,2]\n","shape = [3,]\n","stride = [1,]\n","```\n","\n","We could broadcast the shape to (3,3), which would change the Matrix to be the following:\n","\n","```\n","data = [0,1,2]\n","shape = [3,3]\n","stride = [0,1]\n","```\n","\n","If we printed this out, we would have the following matrix:\n","\n","```\n","[[0,1,2],[0,1,2],[0,1,2]]\n","```\n","\n","Notice that we did **not** copy the data to fit the new shape. Here, simply changing the stride was all that was necessary to make this work out. Your goal is to ensure that this operation allows for ```get``` to return the correct values at every index. It is important to note that this would normally return a view, or a read-only version, of the data. In production systems, you would normally implement a \"compact\" function as well, which would force the data to be of the correct shape ahead of future operations. Given the complexity of this operation, we have refrained from asking for an implementation for this question.\n","\n","**Notes**\n","- For broadcasting, we shall only be testing cases where either we add dimensions to the front of the list and cases where we need to change a ```1``` to another value.

You will be given both a ```(n,1)``` dimensional matrix, corresponding to the classifier weights, and a ```(m,n)``` matrix, containing all of the points that need to be classified. A linear regression model simply performs a matrix multiplication between the ```(m,n)``` matrix and the ```(n,1)``` weights, resulting in a ```(m,1)``` vector of predictions. For this problem, you shall need to utilize your implementation of Matrix from question 5.\n","\n","For example, suppose we have the sample weight and data as follows:\n","\n","```\n","weights_data = [2, 3]\n","weights_shape = [2, 1]\n","\n","data_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","data_shape = [3, 2]\n","```\n","\n","The inference result would be the sum of product of the weight and the data, which is:\n","\n","```\n","1*2 + 2*3 = 8\n","3*2 + 4*3 = 18\n","5*2 + 6*3 = 28\n","```\n","\n","To represent it in a matrix format, data(3, 2) x weight(2, 1) = inference result(3, 1). i.e.:\n","\n","```\n","[[1,2],[3,4],[5,6]] x [[2],[3]] = [[8], [18], [28]]\n","```\n","\n","Note the local test for this question depends on your Matrix class implementation, but our autograder uses its own correct implementation, so feel free to submit regardless whether you've implemented the Matrix class"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":60,"id":"e1b6ce95","metadata":{"id":"e1b6ce95","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738597543918,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":104,"user":{"displayName":"Maxim Klinchenko","userId":"05474193940815351820"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["def predict_lr(classifier_weights, data):\n","    '''\n","    Given weights and data, perform matrix multiplication to get the predicted values.\n","\n","    args:\n","        classifier_weights (Matrix): The (n,1) weights of the linear regression model\n","        data (Matrix): The (m,n) data which we want model outputs for\n","\n","    return:\n","       output (Matrix): The (m,1) model output\n","    '''\n","    data_array = np.array(data.data).reshape(data.shape)\n","    weights_array = np.array(classifier_weights.data).reshape(classifier_weights.shape)\n","    output_array = np.dot(data_array, weights_array)\n","    return Matrix(output_array.flatten().tolist(), [output_array.shape[0], 1])\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":59,"id":"rLNPlBKO9QII","metadata":{"id":"rLNPlBKO9QII","tags":["excluded_from_script"],"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1738597416223,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":168,"user":{"displayName":"Maxim Klinchenko","userId":"05474193940815351820"}},"outputId":"e8f25e5c-800c-4392-dd04-05cf4fb42eac"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["All tests passed!\n"]}],"source":["def test_lr():\n","  weights_data = [2, 3]\n","  weights_shape = [2, 1]\n","  weights_matrix = Matrix(weights_data, weights_shape)\n","\n","  data_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","  data_shape = [3, 2]\n","  data_matrix = Matrix(data_data, data_shape)\n","\n","  # Get the predicted values using linear regression inference\n","  predictions = predict_lr(weights_matrix, data_matrix)\n","\n","  # Print the output (m, 1) matrix of predictions\n","  assert predictions.data == [8,18,28]\n","\n","  weights_data = [2, 3, 4]\n","  weights_shape = [3, 1]\n","  weights_matrix = Matrix(weights_data, weights_shape)\n","\n","  data_data = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]\n","  data_shape = [2, 3]\n","  data_matrix = Matrix(data_data, data_shape)\n","\n","  # Get the predicted values using linear regression inference\n","  predictions = predict_lr(weights_matrix, data_matrix)\n","\n","  # Print the output (m, 1) matrix of predictions\n","  assert predictions.data == [20,47]\n","\n","  print(\"All tests passed!\")\n","\n","test_lr()"]}],"metadata":{"celltoolbar":"Tags","colab":{"provenance":[]},"kernel_info":{"name":"python3"},"kernelspec":{"display_name":".venv","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.10.16"},"nteract":{"version":"nteract-front-end@1.0.0"},"toc":{"base_numbering":1,"nav_menu":{},"number_sections":true,"sideBar":true,"skip_h1_title":true,"title_cell":"Table of Contents","title_sidebar":"Contents","toc_cell":true,"toc_position":{},"toc_section_display":true,"toc_window_display":false}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":5}
